Day 1 - 
	Language: JavaScript
	Worked on: Played around with react native. 
	Things learned: 
		1) React Native can be casted to your device. 
		2) React Native uses its own components to access the native components on IOS and Android.
		   One react native component is mapped to IOS/Androids respective native components.
		3) If a folder is not showing up on GitHub then remove the .git/ folder from that subfolder that is not showing up.
